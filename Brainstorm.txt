  Colours and Chaos
  
  
  Colours and Chaos combines:
  - Health and ammo count
  - Every single 2D asset pack
  
  All image and sound credits go to Kenney.
  
Gameplay
  
  - play as an asset cloud
  - e.g. 20 or so green sprites swirling around a point
  
  - click to shoot assets
  - asset launches itself in direction
  - aoe explosion! else shooting too bland
    - point effector for juice
  
  - touching your own colour adds it to your cloud
  - touching any other colour removes the asset
  
  - arena size is restricted
  - each bullet has a 
  - asset fountain in center
  - leaving arena deletes assets
  - 
  
  - enemy ai?
    - pathfinding wil be cancer
  - two players?
