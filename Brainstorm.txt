  Colours and Chaos

  An unlikely combination of animals, tilesets, ufos, etc etc
  blast each other in beautifully vibrant mayhem.
  
Gameplay
  
  - play as an asset cloud
  - e.g. 20 or so green sprites swirling around a point
  
  - click to shoot assets
  - asset launches itself in direction
  - aoe explosion! else shooting too bland
    - point effector for juice
  
  - touching your own colour adds it to your cloud
  - touching any other colour removes the asset
  
  - arena size is restricted
  - asset fountain in center
  - leaving arena deletes assets
